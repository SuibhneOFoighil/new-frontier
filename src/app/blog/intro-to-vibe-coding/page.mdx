# Vibe-Coding: When AI Writes Your Code (And What Could Go Wrong)

You've probably heard the term "vibe-coding" floating around lately, along with all the excitement about AI writing code. But what exactly is it, and should you care if you're not a programmer?

Vibe-coding, as AI researcher **<a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en">Andrej Karpathy</a>** puts it:

<Callout>
"a new kind of coding where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."
</Callout>


In plain English? It means letting AI models make most of the coding decisions for you.

Think of it like the world's most sophisticated autocomplete. But instead of just finishing your sentences, this autocomplete can write entire applications. You give it a direction, and it keeps building, iterating, and expanding in whatever direction feels right. It's coding by **vibes** rather than rigid planning.


## The Power and the Pitfalls

This approach can be incredibly powerful when you have clear guardrails and a specific goal. It's especially great for exploratory work where you can immediately see if something's working – like building a user interface where good design is obvious at first glance.

But here's the catch: *vibe-coding isn't a magic solution for people who don't understand code*. Without proper guidance, AI can go completely off the rails. It might make terrible assumptions because it's missing crucial context. Like a well-meaning but scattered project manager, it can:

- Forget what it was working on
- Start duplicating efforts  
- Completely ignore previous work

The result? A lot of digital *junk* that buries the actually useful parts of your application.

This is where the term **"slop"** gets a whole new meaning – not just low-quality content, but genuinely counterproductive code that makes everything harder to manage.

## Where Vibe-Coding Fits in the Tool Landscape

There are actually tons of tools out there that could qualify as vibe-coding platforms. The key thing to understand is that vibe-coding is more of an **attitude** than a specific method – all you need is an AI interface that can make decisions on your behalf.

I like to think about the landscape in three categories:

<img src="/blogs/intro-to-vibe-coding/tool-map.png" alt="Vibe-Coding Landscape" />

<br/>

1. **Chat-based editors**: These write code in the background but try to only show you the conversation and the UI output. These are probably the most common vibe-coding tools and where the "forget the code exists" philosophy really shines.
2. **Traditional code editors with AI chat**: Pretty much any modern code editor has this today – think *<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>* with *<a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">Copilot</a>* or similar tools. You're still looking at code, but AI is helping write it.
3. **Traditional low/no-code tools**: Platforms like *<a href="https://bubble.io/">Bubble</a>* that use drag-and-drop interfaces. Parts of these apps function like higher-level programming languages, even if they don't look like it.

Vibe-coding lives primarily in categories 1 and 2. It's fantastic for spinning up examples quickly, prototyping ideas, and getting inspired by what's possible. But here's an important reality check: 

<Callout>
I wouldn't recommend using any vibe-coding approach to build a production application.

If you don't know how to code and don't want to learn, honestly? Stick with tools like **<a href="https://bubble.io/">Bubble</a>** that don't require technical expertise. If you want to build a serious production application with code, work in traditional code editors where you maintain control.

But if you want to learn, experiment, and get inspired? **Vibe-coding tools are perfect.**

I often use **<a href="https://v0.dev/">V0</a>** to prototype components, for example. V0 can create beautiful elements – like the custom switch component below – in minutes. Previously, building something this polished might have taken me several days just to learn the different styling syntax.

## So What's Vibe-Coding Actually Good For?

This brings us to the real question: if vibe-coding isn't ideal for production apps, what is it actually good for?

<Callout>
Vibe-coding is great for prototyping, learning, and exploration.
</Callout>

When you need to move fast and iterate quickly, vibe-coding can be incredibly powerful. If you're willing to let go of some control and **"embrace exponentials,"** these tools can take you in directions you never would have thought to explore.

## What's Next?

My current favorite for web applications is **<a href="https://lovable.dev">lovable.dev</a>**, which offers probably the most complete ecosystem for beginners. If mobile apps are more your thing, **<a href="https://kiki.dev">kiki.dev</a>** is worth checking out.
