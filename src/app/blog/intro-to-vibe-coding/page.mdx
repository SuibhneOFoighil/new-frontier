# Vibe-Coding: When AI Writes Your Code (And What Could Go Wrong)

You've probably heard the term "vibe-coding" floating around lately, along with all the excitement about AI writing code. But what exactly is it, and should you care if you're not a programmer?

Vibe-coding, as AI researcher Andrej Karpathy puts it:

<Callout>
"a new kind of coding where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."

In plain English? It means letting AI models make most of the coding decisions for you.

Think of it like the world's most sophisticated autocomplete. But instead of just finishing your sentences, this autocomplete can write entire applications. You give it a direction, and it keeps building, iterating, and expanding in whatever direction feels right. It's coding by **vibes** rather than rigid planning.

## The Power and the Pitfalls

This approach can be incredibly powerful when you have clear guardrails and a specific goal. It's especially great for exploratory work where you can immediately see if something's working – like building a user interface where good design is obvious at first glance.

But here's the catch: vibe-coding isn't a magic solution for people who don't understand code. Without proper guidance, AI can go completely off the rails. It might make terrible assumptions because it's missing crucial context. Like a well-meaning but scattered project manager, it can:

- Forget what it was working on
- Start duplicating efforts  
- Completely ignore previous work

The result? A lot of digital junk that buries the actually useful parts of your application.

This is where the term **"slop"** gets a whole new meaning – not just low-quality content, but genuinely counterproductive code that makes everything harder to manage.

## Getting Started with Vibe-Coding

However, if you're curious about dipping your toes into vibe-coding, there are some excellent beginner-friendly tools out there:

- **<a href="https://lovable.dev">lovable.dev</a>** – My current favorite, offering probably the most complete ecosystem for building web applications without deep technical knowledge
- **<a href="https://kiki.dev">kiki.dev</a>** – Worth checking out if mobile apps are more your thing

## What's Next?

To show you what this looks like in practice, I'll walk through building the frontend for my education platform, **MOLUS**, using lovable – you'll see both the magic and the potential pitfalls of letting AI take the wheel.
