# The University of Michigan's DEI Dismantling: A Crisis of Institutional Courage

In an act that speaks volumes about institutional courage in our current political landscape, the University of Michigan has dismantled its entire Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion program—once the largest university-based initiative of its kind in the nation.

<Callout>
What does it signify when an institution constructs an elaborate framework of principles when culturally expedient, only to dismantle it entirely when the political calculus shifts?
</Callout>

The implications extend far beyond a single administrative decision or budget reallocation; they strike at the fundamental question of whether our most prestigious public institutions possess any foundational values beyond **survival and market position**.

## The Rise and Fall of Michigan's DEI Commitment

Under former President Mark Schlissel's leadership, Michigan positioned itself as a **national leader** in institutional diversity efforts, committing substantial resources to programs designed to create a more inclusive campus environment.

Despite the controversy surrounding Schlissel's eventual departure, his administration's emphasis on diversifying our community represented a clear institutional priority—one that resonated with many in the university ecosystem.

When Santa Ono assumed leadership, initial signals suggested continuity in this commitment, with public statements reinforcing the importance of inclusion in maintaining Michigan's academic excellence.

<Callout>
Yet as federal political pressure mounted under the Trump administration, that commitment evaporated with stunning rapidity—revealing how contingent these "core values" truly were.
</Callout>

The complete elimination of the program—not a strategic reduction or thoughtful reimagining—demonstrates an institution reacting from **fear rather than principle**.

## Beyond Political Expediency: The Deeper Failures

To be clear, legitimate criticisms of Michigan's DEI approach existed long before external pressure forced its hand.

The program had grown unwieldy, often prioritizing *symbolic gestures* over substantive change—a common critique from both supporters and skeptics of institutional diversity initiatives.

A thoughtful administration might have used this moment to refine rather than retreat—to address valid concerns while reinforcing essential commitments to equity and inclusion.

Instead, Michigan chose the path of least resistance, suggesting these initiatives were always more about **institutional branding** than genuine transformation.

<Callout>
When confronted with the prospect of federal scrutiny, the administration revealed its priorities: institutional self-preservation trumped the commitments made to marginalized communities within its walls.
</Callout>

## The Marketization of Public Education

This capitulation reflects a more profound transformation of public higher education in America—a shift from institutions of public service to **competitive market entities**.

Since the 1970s, state funding for public universities has plummeted from approximately **64% of institutional revenue to below 13%** at many flagship institutions, including Michigan.

This financial reality has reshaped institutional priorities, transforming what was once primarily an in-state educational resource into what increasingly resembles a *global boarding school for the privileged*.

The University of Michigan now functions less as a public good and more as a brand—one where "Go Blue" merchandise, luxury student housing, and football tailgates have displaced the democratic purpose of accessible education.

When financial imperatives dominate, principles become flexible—leading to precisely the kind of value collapse we witness in this DEI decision.

## The Community Impact

As both an alumnus and lifelong resident of Ann Arbor, I've observed this transformation with mounting concern for what it means for our community and state.

The university that once served as Michigan's primary **ladder of opportunity** now increasingly functions as a mechanism for reproducing privilege—with admission increasingly correlated with family wealth and connections.

<Callout>
Key Statistics:

- Nearly **49%** of U-M's undergraduates were from outside Michigan by 2023
- Median rent in Ann Arbor: **$2,140 per month**
</Callout>

Meanwhile, the university's massive physical and economic footprint in Ann Arbor creates housing pressures and economic distortions that impact long-term residents—many of whom increasingly feel like unwelcome bystanders in a university town that no longer serves them.

When the institution abandons commitments to diversity and inclusion, it signals to marginalized communities both within and beyond campus that their belonging remains **conditional and subject to political calculation**.

## Institutional Courage in an Age of Authoritarianism

The deeper question this capitulation raises: what is the purpose of institutions that claim to advance human knowledge and wisdom if they lack the courage to stand for anything beyond their own perpetuation?

Can the University of Michigan claim with any credibility to champion truth when it so readily abandons other proclaimed values under pressure?

What example does this set for students about institutional integrity and moral courage in the face of authoritarian demands?

The administration's decision suggests a troubling answer: when sufficiently threatened, even our most prestigious institutions will **sacrifice principles for survival**.

This pattern emerges not from individual moral failings but from structural transformations in how we fund and govern public education—changes that have rendered these institutions increasingly vulnerable to both market and political pressures.

## The Path Forward: Reclaiming Our Public University

At the heart of this institutional failure lies a fundamental challenge: how do we rebuild public universities that genuinely serve the public good?

<Callout>
The Solution:

- Restore robust public funding
- Reduce dependence on market forces and wealthy donors
- Strengthen accountability to public values
</Callout>

When institutions derive their financial security primarily from public investment, they become more accountable to public values rather than market pressures or political whims.

This isn't merely about reversing budget cuts but about **reimagining the social contract** between our public universities and the communities they're meant to serve.

Yet funding alone won't resolve the crisis of institutional courage we've witnessed. We need mechanisms that hold universities accountable to their stated principles, even when those principles become politically inconvenient.

## What Do You Think?

I've shared my perspective as a lifelong Ann Arbor resident and Michigan alumnus, but I recognize the limitations of my viewpoint and experience.

What do you think must change for the University of Michigan to reclaim its purpose as a genuine public institution that serves all Michiganders?

How do we build institutions with the courage to stand firm on principle, even when facing political pressure from the highest levels of government?

What role should community members, alumni, students, and faculty play in holding the university accountable to its proclaimed values?

Comment below with your thoughts, experiences, and ideas. This conversation is just beginning, and meaningful change will require collective wisdom and action.
