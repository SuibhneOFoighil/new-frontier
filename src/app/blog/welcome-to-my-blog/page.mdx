# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome to my blog! This is my first post written in **MDX**, which allows me to combine Markdown with React components.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

Here's what makes MDX special:

- **Markdown syntax** for easy writing
- **React components** for interactive content
- **Type safety** with TypeScript support
- **Great developer experience** with syntax highlighting

## Code Examples

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

And here's some TypeScript:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const user: User = {
  name: 'Suibhne',
  email: 'hello@suibhne.blog'
};
```

## Lists and Quotes

Here are some benefits of using MDX for blogging:

1. **Easy to write** - Just use Markdown syntax
2. **Powerful** - Add React components when needed
3. **Flexible** - Customize styling with Tailwind CSS
4. **Fast** - Built on Next.js for optimal performance

## What's Next?

In future posts, I'll cover:

- Advanced MDX techniques
- Building custom components
- SEO optimization
- Performance best practices

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more content!
